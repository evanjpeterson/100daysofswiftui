# 100 Days of SwiftUI

Many thanks to Paul Hudson at Hacking with Swift for arranging this course!

I'm going to upload the exercises as I finish them.
Many of the days are guided walkthroughs, though I'll usually play around a bit rather than just copy/paste Paul's code.

Some days are self-directed coding challenges.

I'm also posting screenshots to X (https://x.com/evanjpx) to help document each day.
